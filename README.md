- 👋 Hi, I’m @kristinakasalova

- 🌱 I’m currently learning HTML, CSS, React, JavaScript, Node.js, PostgreSQL and else following the course for Fullstack developers from Zero to Mastery at Udemy.com (https://www.udemy.com/course/the-complete-web-developer-zero-to-mastery/learn/lecture/8803510). Most of the projects/repos here I built as an assignment from this course. However, looking forward to other new projects once I finish the course. 

- 👀 I’m interested in fullstack or back-end projects.

- 📫 Feel free to reach out to me via email at kkasalova.professional@gmail.com.
